# Web-Scraping-Flipkart

This project has been made for fun, where I have used Python to scrape all the data from Flipkart which is an E-commerce market place based on the product category like headphones, keyboards, etc. on the basis of popularity.

All the data which is retrived is first being stored in csv files and then stored in MySQL database once all the Scraping is completed.

All the scraping and rest of the information can be seen on web UI which built using StreamLit
